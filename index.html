            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h5>Future Web/Dev</h5>
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Carlos Osuna and I am currently studying to become a Web Developer
                or a Front End Developer and can't wait for what the future holds. I have experience on working with 
                HTML, CSS and JavaScript so far but, even though its not a lot now I am more than motivated
                to keep pushing forward to achieve my dreams. Besides Web Dev I am also interested in other languages 
                like C++ to start coding and desingning videogames on Unreal Engine 5. It may be a lot but its exiting 
                to be challenged every day and all the pressure that it takes, but at the end I wont give up until 
                the goals are fullfilled. It is also important to push the people around me and motivate them towards
                their goals, because coworkers/teamates are what makes a person what it is at the end of the story.
            </p>
